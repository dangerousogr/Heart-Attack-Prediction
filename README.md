This objective of this project is to perform heart attack prediction for patients based on a set of health information. The data is obtained from kaggle
and is a very common dataset for machine learning applications. Common libraries used in this project are pandas, numpy, tensorflow, sklearn and keras.

The project aims to perform such prediction using different machine learning models. Some of the models deployed in this code are:
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Neural Network Classifier (4 layers) 
3. K-Nearest Neighbor
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest

All these models perform the prediction and their performance is compared based on metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.

We also introduce callback features such as early stopping and lr scheduler to reduce overfitting for the neural network.
